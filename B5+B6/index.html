                    History, steps to the podium. <br> Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of
                    late
                    Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
                <p></p> Scott Sampson
                is a Canadian - born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto.
